# S-ESX-V1F-kash
 Ok long of the short is this is a update to S-ESX-V1-FINAL
 
 Now for the fun stuff:
 
 after the sql import open the server.cfg and set # esx_kashacters to read ensure esx_kashacters
 
 then goto esx_extended and open config.lua set Config.MultiCharacter = true
 
 after that goto esx_ambulancejob and open config.lua and set Config.MultiCharacter
 
 save all your work and start your server (i should not have to tell you how to set up artifacts to use this)
